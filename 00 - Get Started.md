## Before anything else
You need a method to practice so you have here several options:
- You have no problem to get your hands dirty
1. Download and install [Microsoft® SQL Server® 2019 Express](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=101064).
2. If you will use Microsoft SQL Server you also need a client and here I recommend [Azure Data Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio) or [SQL Server Management Studio(SSMS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms). One of them will do, not both.
- You do not want to install anything
1. Enroll in the online course of Microsoft Learn, [**Get started with Transact-SQL programming**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/get-started-transact-sql-programming/) and then in the [**Unit 6 - Exercise: Program with T-SQL**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/get-started-transact-sql-programming/6-exercise-program-transact-sql) you have access to a Virtual Machine using your browser.
2. [**w3schools - SQL Tutorial**](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp) has a *Try it Yourself* feature.
